## 🖌️ Overview  

Agisoft Metashape Professional is a powerful photogrammetry tool designed for creating highly accurate 3D spatial data from digital images. The software is widely used in **archaeology, GIS applications, game development, surveying, and visual effects production**.  

It allows users to process aerial and close-range images, generating textured polygonal models, dense point clouds, DEMs (Digital Elevation Models), and orthomosaics. Thanks to advanced algorithms, Metashape ensures precision while remaining optimized for performance even on large datasets.  

The program supports automated workflows as well as manual editing tools, making it suitable for both professional production environments and academic research. With built-in scripting support (Python), users can integrate Metashape into custom pipelines and automate repetitive tasks.
